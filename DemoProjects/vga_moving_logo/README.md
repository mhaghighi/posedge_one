# Displays a moving logo on VGA output

# Requires:
+ POSEDGE-ONE FPGA development board (https://goo.gl/t1AJ4d)
+ VGA-6 or VGA-12 wing (https://goo.gl/2qNdXL , https://goo.gl/iM3Rg4)

# Howto:
Place VGA-12 on wing-2 and programm the FPGA with "/ise/build/vga_top.bit"
or alternativly place VGA-6 on wing-2 pins 9-16 and programm the FPGA with "/ise/build/vga6_top.bit"
